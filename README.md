# Nature Connect

Nature Connect is a web application take on the classic connect four game!

## Motivation

This project was built for a 2-day hackathon and grew out of our desire to expand our javascript skills while making a simple game with a clear Nature theme.

## Usage

To add more depth to our connect 4 game we programmed a simple AI to enable single player play. Single player mode is the default, and prospective players only need to select their token choices before clicking the start button!
